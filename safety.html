            Introduction To Safety
        </h1>
        <p>
            Before you start snowmobiling you need to know how to be safe.
            If you have never snowmobiled before then you should ride with a buddy<br></br> or someone whos experienced to learn and understand how to drive a snowmobile.
            Even if you are experienced you still need to be careful so you dont risk yours or other peoples safety.
            I advise enrolling in a snowmobile safety course.

        <p>
            Some things you need to know to be safe are what equipment you should wear, what signs mean, what side of the trail you should be on and how fast you should be going around blind corners.
            <br></br>You should always let someone know where your going and which trails you plan on taking and make sure you know where to go, bring a phone incase you break down or your in need for help.
            NEVER ride under the influence and always bring an emergency kit incase something happens, <br></br>even if you dont think anything will because you never know if you or someone else will need it.
            ALWAYS wear a snowmobile helmet and the weather conditions before riding.
